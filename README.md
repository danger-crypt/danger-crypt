![I'm an aspiring Software Dev, Game Dev, and a Gamer!](https://ibb.co/8nHWHyWC)

I'm in my mid 20s, I live in the U.S.

My entire formal work history is actually only limited to construction and factory jobs, having started working at 18 following earning my G.E.D.

It was roughly 2-3 years ago I decided I wanted to do something different, and build a *real* career for myself, instead of back-breaking, nonstop overtime, paycheck to paycheck jobs for the rest of my life.

I've been self-taught, using various online learning resources and curriculum. While I am currently open for job opportunities, I understand my present lack of any formal education inhibits me being a worthy or ideal candidate to bring on for any sort of projects or opportunities. 

Therefore, as I continue my self-education journey, I'm slowly building a portfolio which will speak for itself in situations where people are looking for developers. 

Skills: HTML | CSS | C# | Python

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Building my dev portfolio, and learning how to mod as well as general game development! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning freeCodeCamp's `Certified-FullStack-Developer` Curriculum [Currently on CSS portion of Course] | Arma - Reforger's YouTube Series `Modding Bootcamp` 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Making mods for PC games. Arma:Reforger is what I play a lot right now, and would love to collab with someone or people on modding. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Game Modding | General Developer Mentoring | Anyone willing to show me any advice or knowledge they wish to, lol. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Collaborating on some Modding Projects or playing some Arma! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord | Twitch | Steam 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His

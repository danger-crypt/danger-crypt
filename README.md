-  Whaaatttupp, I’m @danger-crypt

    -- Video games and discovering new mods to play with
    -- Art, such as drawing and sketching with graphite, charcoal, pastel, and ink.
    -- History and mythology; I really enjoy learning about ancient history, the way people lived throughout different peroids of time and things of the sort. As well as what the beliefs people held throughout different peroids of time.
    -- Science, Universe
